# Anidex description
The goal of this project was to gamify the experience of uncovering wildlife. It is similar to Pokemon in the sense that the user is prompted to go around the environment and capture images of species to add to their collection. Using generative AI, Anidex can classify animal species as well as provide a descriptive summary of their qualities. As a result, users are provided with an in-depth educational platform that drives curiosity for our wildlife. 

# setup
Clone the repository and go into the frontend directory. Run the command:
```
npm run build
```
Go back into the GenesisAI directory, run the command:
```
npm run start
```
You'll be given a local host server that you can now use to access the project.
